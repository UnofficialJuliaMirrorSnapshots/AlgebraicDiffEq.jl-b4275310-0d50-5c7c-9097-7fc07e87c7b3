AlgebraicDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
differential algebraic equation solvers and utilities. While completely independent
and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).

**Note:** This library is, at least for now, deprecated and all of its functionality was moved to the component packages.
